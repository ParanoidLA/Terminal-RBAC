README: Minimalist Terminal-Based RBAC System

Introduction

I took a different approach creativity-wise and developed this minimalist and unique terminal-based RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system. This project offers a refreshing take on user interfaces, emulating a terminal-like experience for executing commands and managing user roles. The simplicity of the interface complements the core functionalities of a robust RBAC system while providing a unique, engaging user interaction.

Features

	1.	Terminal-Like Interface
Users interact with the app via a command-line interface styled for the web, making the experience both nostalgic and modern.
	2.	Role-Based Permissions
	â€¢	Admin: Can view roles and perform all actions, including managing users and roles.
	â€¢	Moderator: Limited access to logs for audit purposes.
	â€¢	User: Basic access to personal information using commands like whoami.
	3.	Command Handling
The app supports multiple commands for different roles:
	â€¢	login: Log into the system with your email and password.
	â€¢	signup: Register as a new user.
	â€¢	whoami: Display the current userâ€™s details.
	â€¢	logs: View logs (for moderators and above).
	â€¢	view-roles: View the roles of all users (admin only).
	4.	Dynamic Role Expiry
Users can be assigned roles with an expiry date (not applicable to Super Admins).
	5.	IP Address Tracking
The system tracks the IP addresses used to log in for security and troubleshooting.
	6.	Error Handling
Ensures smooth user experience by gracefully handling errors such as undefined data or insufficient permissions.

Technology Stack

	â€¢	Frontend: React (with a terminal-styled interface)
	â€¢	Backend: Firebase Authentication & Firestore
	â€¢	Deployment: Hosted locally or on any platform that supports React apps

â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx                   # App entry point

Key Highlights

	1.	Unique Interface
Designed to feel like a terminal, the app combines a retro feel with modern web technologies.
	2.	Security-Oriented Design
Includes features like IP tracking and role expiry, ensuring robust role management.
	3.	Expandable Design
Built with scalability in mind. New roles, commands, or functionalities can be added effortlessly.

Deployment Instructions

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-rbac.git
cd terminal-rbac


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Configure Firebase:
	â€¢	Set up a Firebase project.
	â€¢	Add Firestore with the following collections:
	â€¢	users: Store user details, roles, and IPs.
	â€¢	Update firebaseConfig in FirebaseHelper.js.
	4.	Start the app:

npm start


	5.	Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Known Issues

	â€¢	Undefined Data Handling: Errors may occur if Firestore collections are empty or improperly configured. Ensure the users collection is initialized with valid data.
	â€¢	Permission Messages: Ensure role definitions in Permissions.js align with the commands in CommandHandler.jsx.

Future Enhancements

	1.	Multi-Role System: Support users with multiple roles simultaneously.
	2.	Audit Trail: Add detailed logging of all user actions for better traceability.
	3.	Dark Mode: Enhance the terminalâ€™s aesthetic with theming options.
	4.	Localization: Support commands and output in multiple languages.

Conclusion

This project reflects a unique approach to role-based access control by marrying functionality with a creative terminal-style interface. The design and simplicity aim to provide a clean, nostalgic experience for users while maintaining the core principles of RBAC.
